# Maven-Store-Analysis
This project applies data analysis techniques to uncover business insights, optimize operations, and support data-driven decision-making aimed at improving sales performance.
## Objective:
Create a sales performance dashboard for a global electronics retailer to
consolidate and analyze sales, customer, product, and store data. The dashboard
will track key performance metrics, uncover sales trends, and provide actionable
insights for management to make data-driven decisions.

## Company Overview:
Maven Electronics is a global retailer that sells computers, cell phones, TVs,
cameras, appliances, and other consumer products through both online and in-store
channels. The company operates across multiple regions and aims to improve
profitability, monitor store and product performance, and enhance customer
satisfaction.

## Business Problem:
Revenue has been on a downward trend since 2020, and management currently
lacks a unified view of performance across sales channels, regions, and customer
demographics. Without an interactive dashboard, it is difficult to identify top-
performing products, regions, and customer segments, or to understand areas of
declining performance. Management needs a consolidated data model and an
interactive report to explore key sales drivers, monitor revenue and profit trends,
and evaluate store and product-level performance.
