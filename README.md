# Maven-Store-Analysis
This project applies data analysis techniques to uncover business insights, optimize operations, and support data-driven decision-making aimed at improving sales performance.
## Objective:
Create a sales performance dashboard for a global electronics retailer to
consolidate and analyze sales, customer, product, and store data. The dashboard
will track key performance metrics, uncover sales trends, and provide actionable
insights for management to make data-driven decisions.

## Company Overview:
Maven Electronics is a global retailer that sells computers, cell phones, TVs,
cameras, appliances, and other consumer products through both online and in-store
channels. The company operates across multiple regions and aims to improve
profitability, monitor store and product performance, and enhance customer
satisfaction.

## Business Problem:
Revenue has been on a downward trend since 2020, and management currently
lacks a unified view of performance across sales channels, regions, and customer
demographics. Without an interactive dashboard, it is difficult to identify top-
performing products, regions, and customer segments, or to understand areas of
declining performance. Management needs a consolidated data model and an
interactive report to explore key sales drivers, monitor revenue and profit trends,
and evaluate store and product-level performance.

## Insights
#### Key Insights from the Dashboard
1. Revenue, Cost, and Profit Are All Down vs Last Year
- Revenue: 878K, down 44.93% YoY
- Cost: 363.98K, down 44.93% YoY
- Profit: 514.05K, down 44.93% YoY
- This indicates that the business is experiencing a broad decline in operational activity compared to last year. The proportional drop across all three suggests fewer sales overall, not necessarily worsening efficiency.
2. Strong Month-over-Month Recovery
- Revenue is up 303% MoM,
- Cost is up 306% MoM,
- Profit is up 301% MoM,
- Orders up 424% MoM.
- This shows a strong short-term rebound, meaning the business is picking up again after a weak previous month. The spike in demand should be investigated to understand what changed.
3. Customer Channel Distribution
- Online: 75.9%
- In-store: 24.1%
- The business is heavily driven by online sales. This is a major advantage for scalability, but it also suggests dependence on digital channels.
4. Currency Code Breakdown
- USD: 57.88% of cost
- Others (EUR, CAD, GBP, AUD) make up the remaining shares.
- This means the business is highly exposed to USD transactions. This can have implications for exchange-rate risk.
5. Cost Trend by Month
- Costs peaked early in the year and then declined sharply from March onward.
- The lowest point is around May–June, with only slight rises later.
- This trend mirrors the YoY performance declines and shows weaker activity as the year progressed.
6. Top Product Brands Driving Costs
- Highest-cost brands include:
- Adventure Works
- Wide World Importers
- Contoso
- Fabrikam
- These brands represent the largest cost centers and likely the major product lines.
7. Product Categories Contributing Most to Cost
- Computers dominate total cost by a wide margin (the largest category).
- Followed by: Cameras & Camcorders, Cell Phones, TV & Video, Home Appliances.
- This suggests the business is heavily invested in technology and electronics inventory.
8. Order Volume (1K Orders)
- Down 42.28% YoY but up 424% MoM.
- Again, showing significant short-term recovery but long-term decline.
#### Overall Interpretation
The business is experiencing a significant annual decline in demand and sales activity, but the last month shows major recovery, suggesting either seasonal demand, a recent promotional campaign, or operational improvements.
Operational cost and revenue movements are aligned, meaning efficiency has not worsened; the real issue is volume.
Online channels remain the key driver and should continue to be optimized.

## Recommendations
1. Investigate the Cause of the YoY Decline
The business is down 44.9% YoY across revenue, cost, profit, and orders.
Conduct deeper analysis to identify:
- Decline in product demand
- Marketing inefficiencies
- Loss of key customer segments
- Pricing or competition changes
Understanding the root cause will guide corrective strategy.
2. Capitalize on the Strong Month-over-Month Rebound
Since revenue and orders jumped 300–400% MoM, identify what triggered this surge:
- Promotions?
- Marketing campaigns?
- Seasonal events?
- New product launches?
Whatever worked should be replicated, optimized, and scaled.
3. Strengthen Online Sales Strategy
With 76% of customers buying online, focus resources on:
- Improving website/app user experience
- Faster checkout and delivery processes
- Retargeting ads for abandoned carts
- Social media campaigns
- Loyalty programs aimed at online buyers
This is the business’s strongest and most scalable channel.
4. Optimize High-Cost Categories
“Computers” and other tech categories drive the largest share of total cost.
Consider:
Negotiating supplier discounts
- Reducing low-margin or slow-moving subcategories
- Monitoring inventory levels more tightly
- Prioritizing high-profit items within these categories
This will help protect margins.
5. Review Dependence on USD Purchases
With USD representing 57.8% of total cost, the business is exposed to currency fluctuations.
Recommended actions:
- Diversify suppliers into EUR, GBP, CAD where possible
- Explore hedging or forward contracts if dealing in large volumes
- Renegotiate currency terms with existing suppliers
This reduces exchange-rate risks.
6. Revive In-Store Sales
In-store customers make up only 24%.
To grow this segment:
- Introduce in-store promotions and bundles
- Improve store layout and customer service experience
- Use online channels to drive foot traffic (e.g. “pick up in store and save”)
A stronger offline presence will reduce overreliance on online channels.
7. Focus on High-Performing Brands
Top brands like Adventure Works and Wide World Importers drive most costs, meaning they likely represent major sales volume.
Recommendations:
- Increase visibility and promotions for these brands
- Ensure consistent stock availability
- Consider exclusive deals or partnerships
This strengthens sales performance in top categories.
8. Address the Mid-Year Drop in Cost and Activity
The cost trend shows a steep decline from March to June, indicating slow business activity.
Actions:
- Conduct seasonal trend analysis
- Adjust inventory purchases to match demand cycles
- Launch promotions during historically slow months
This will stabilize revenue throughout the year.
9. Enhance Marketing and Customer Retention
With falling YoY performance, customer churn may be happening.
Recommendations:
- Start a customer loyalty program
- Use data to create segmented email or SMS marketing
- Improve after-sales services
- Invest in targeted ads for high-value customer groups
Retention is cheaper than acquiring new customers.
